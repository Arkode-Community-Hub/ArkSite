# ArkSite developer contribution guide.

This document defines rules and best practice for streamlined contribution to the ArkSite platform. To guarantee the quick approval of contributions, please read and respect this guide as thoroughly as possible. Otherwise changes may be rejected. Contributors who clearly haven't read or respected the guide will have changes rejected with little to no feedback. Smaller issues, such as a misunderstanding or single rule non-compliance will still be rejected, but with clear and constructive feedback.

ArkSite is an open-source project ran by the Arkode community, who are volunteers. This guide has been created to help contributors better respect the time of the repository admins, as well as foster an atmosphere of quality and peer engagement. We aren't solo players at Arkode.

## Overview
Managing this project is a challenging task, so formalizing feature and bug requests through the same system helps us keep a central overview of the projects development, and is a big help for us. 

"Git issues" as they're known, are a feature of the GitHub ecosystem, and are a way to quantify an individual implementable task or feature.
